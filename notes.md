## Similar Applications to Each Section

- Stats = At the Ballpark Profile Like (My History Section)
- Scorecard = unique but it is a baseball scorecard (Examples???)
- Journal = Travel Journal Features (Examples???)

## How the application works

1. Home is the public feed where all users posts will be
   - a. The Feed consists of the Community Posts
   - b. When creating each of the other types of Journals, Scorecards, and Statistics the form will ask if you want to post it to the Community Feed
   - c. Each Post has the ability to comment on the Post
2. Journals is all the details of a specific trip to a stadium
   - a. Add to the journal entry the Stadium went to name
   - b. Add to the journal entry the people who went on the trip (have the ability to find other users on the platform)
   - c. Add to the journal entry the Duration of the trip from home (date and time) to stadium or city where the stadium is (date and time)
   - d. Add to the journal entry where we sat for the game, Section, Row, Seat, and a short description
   - e. Add to the journal entry the Routes taken to and from the stadium
   - f. Add to the journal entry the start of the game, the official start time of the game, game duration, the temperature at game time, the weather during the game, and the attendance of the game
   - g. Add to the journal entry the two teams who played the game, the Winning pitcher of record, and the Losing pitcher of record (if different then the starting pitchers add a checkbox for starters)
   - h. Add to the journal entry for what happened during the game
   - i. Add to the journal entry a place for any additional notes

   - k. Add to the journal entry the details outside of the stadium like flight, hotel, and anything additional, etc.
   - l. Add to the journal entry a place for pictures and videos album
3. Scorecards is just an exact replica of a baseball scorecard where you add each inning pitch by pitch by out, but digitally so it is easy enough to add the details as you watch the game
4. Statistics is just a place to calculate and display how many stadiums you went to, your record at each stadium, How many baseball games each year, How many visits lifetime at that specific stadium (User cannot interact with the page)
5. The Web Application will be the same as the Native App except for one difference, there will be an in-app camera button to take photos and videos live during the game (look at snapchat for this feature)
